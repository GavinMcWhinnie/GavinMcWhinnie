			<h4>My website:</h4>
			<br>
			<h4>I have enjoyed making websites for as long as I have been in to programming - they served as a great introduction to the world of
			computer science. Javascript was the first programming language I learnt as I discovered I could use it to move and provide functionality
			to my web pages. This then lead to me learning Python, then C++, now Haskell and Java at University.</h4>

			<h4>The previous version of my website looked like this:
			<img src="../images/previous_website.png" class="interview_image">
			<br><br>
			And can be accessed with this <a href="../previous/index.html">link</a>.
			<br><br>
			It had impressive smooth transitions between pages and had a relatively simple design with nice isomorphic cube pattern designs.
			However, the smooth transitions and fades probably out-shone any content that I put on it and I quickly realised it would be
			a nightmare to try make responsive.
			<br>
			I therefore decided to switch to a simpler design, which is what you see right now.
