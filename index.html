<h1>Monday Badminton News:</h1>
<p>
Coach Munro's (i.e. senior pupil connor munro, booncer munro, supreme leader munro) offical page is now open. <br>
Don't worry connor this is only dummy text I'll think of something meaningful later. (or will I?) <br>
Coach Munro offers coaching sessions after school at Balwearie High School on Mondays. It is very high quality <br>
coaching as he has recieved many prizes and awards for his performance as a coach, leader and all-round <br>
badminton superstar. Among these awards are: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Duke of Edinburgh</li>
  <li>That's it</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
We hope you can find time to come to coach's training sessions as currently there is a fine young squad of first <br>
years which are being superbly coached, but coach would be happy to welcome many more... <br>
Joining is free and is as easy as 1-2-3: <br>
<ol>
  <li>Prepare mentally, coach's sessions are tough</li>
  <li>Get some gear, typically shorts, t-shirt and trainers</li>
  <li>Come along to the sports hall after school on a Monday!</li>
</ol>
Hope to see along you soon! <br>

<h1>Head Boy Competition News:</h1>
<p>
In other news, the stiff competition for head boy has been heating up. Ben MacDonald, the conservative favourite, (at least
in his eyes) has been making declarative statements about his earliness. Max, however, has been making no such statements
but has still been considered in the run for head boy in his quest to annoy Ben.<br><br>
The only other competitor to be considered by the number 1 squad of Mr McNeil and crew is rich-kid John Millar. We highly doubt
he will take home top prize, but who knows...

<h1>MVP news!</h1>
<p>MVP has officially saved 1 first year from being bullied! This first year is currently recovering in Mrs William's classroom
and is expected to make a full recovery. We are still looking to recruit to help save more of the 1/6 of the Balwearie population
that is being bullied.
